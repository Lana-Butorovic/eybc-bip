This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

If you are planning to contribute to the project, first fork the repo.

Then, clone the repo to your local device:
`git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/eybc-bip.git`

Set the original as your upstream:
`git remote add upstream https://github.com/aj-may/eybc-bip.git`

Hint: to pull changes merged by other contributors to your local fork, run:
`git pull upstream main`

Before installing packages or running the development server, make sure that your environment variables are set up properly by checking in with a member of the team.

Then, install dev packages with yarn or node:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
